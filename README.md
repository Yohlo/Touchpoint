# Touchpoint
Simple button pushing game for Android

In this fast-paced game, your goal is to stay alive for as long as possible and get the highest score. How do you score? It's easy - press the green buttons.

There is a two-second timer that counts down and once it hits zero, the game is over. Pressing a green button resets the timer to two seconds and adds to your score. But be careful, red buttons appear randomly and quickly. When a red button is pressed, it's an automatic game over.
